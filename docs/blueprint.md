## Original User Request:
Design a command-line library management system with the following features:

Book Management

Add new books with details: title, author, ISBN (unique), genre, publication year, and total copies.

Track available copies (automatically updated when books are checked out/returned).

Member Management

Register members with name, contact information, and a unique member ID.

Track books currently checked out by a member (limit: 3 books per member).

Checkout & Return

Checkout books: Verify availability, update memberâ€™s checked-out list, set due date (14 days from checkout).

Return books: Update availability, calculate fines ($0.50/day if overdue).

Search & Reports

Search books by title, author, genre, or ISBN, and display availability.

Generate reports:

All checked-out books (with due dates and member details).

Overdue books (highlight fines owed).

List of all available books.

List of all members.

Data Persistence

Store book and member data in CSV/text files. Reload data when the program restarts.

User Interface

Text-based menu with options:

Copy
1. Add Book  
2. Register Member  
3. Checkout Book  
4. Return Book  
5. Search Books  
6. Generate Report  
7. Exit  
Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-existent ISBN/member ID, invalid dates).

Example Workflow:

A librarian uses the system to add a new book ("The Great Gatsby", ISBN 12345, 5 copies).

Member "Alice" (ID 001) checks out the book. The system reduces available copies to 4 and logs a due date.

When Alice returns the book 16 days later, the system calculates a $1.00 fine and updates availability to 5.

Technical Notes:

Use Python (or a language of your choice) with basic file I/O for data storage.

Include input validation and error handling.

Deliverable:
A working script with the above functionality and documentation on how to run it.
